## Problem Statement
The mega waste management projects in India,are majorly managed by private entities on a contract basis. Here, the waste is processed in multiple chambers, primarily wet and dry waste is segregated and then processed into bio gas and solid by products which are used in generation of electricity and, in cement, concrete and road construction and recyclable plastic industries respectively. </br>
That means not only the waste products processed can be utilized as revenue streams but also that the fudge secreted during the processes is disposed-of unchecked, in the environment causing ecological imbalance.</br>
However, for the above mechanisms to be successfully executed the incoming waste has to be segregated in the segregation chamber. In India, usually waste is not segregated hence there is a need for these contractors to hire manual laborers to manually segregate the waste into wet and dry before sending it further to their own, above mentioned treatment chambers.</br>
Though manual scavenging is banned in India, but still we see people doing it. Scavenging of sewage drains is being done by machines in some areas but roadside drains are still cleaned manually everywhere. A proper protection gear should be provided to each one of them.</br>
In such harsh conditions the presence of proper gears and proper equipment becomes a necessity. Hence, a record of gears and equipment provided by the plant to the manual workers, as well as keeping a track of costs and uses of the utilities is important.     </br>

## Proposed Solution
Providing gear to every worker can solve health issues. Keeping a proper track of the gear distribution can prevent pilferage and selling them in black. If it is done we can insure to some extent that every labor is provided with specific protection gears needed by him after the tender has been sanctioned by the authority. Also the worker should be taught how to use that gear and should be given enough knowledge about the same.
## Product
We have came up with an inventory management system where the supervisors and inventory managers can not only keep track of the equipments and utilities provided to the manual laborers but also add new equipments, update existing tools, delete redundant tools and either browse through all the tools in the inventory or search for a specific one, or filter through tools in a value range, or category-wise (hard hats, bodysuit, gloves etc).</br>
We have provided track if the gear has been received by the labor and if not an alert is sent the distributer person. If the distributor doesnâ€™t provide him the gear within specified time and has many such complaints pending an alert for it is sent to the higher authority. We have also added a face recognition timestamp for the exchange of utilities between the recognised workers and the inventory. </br>
This website will also help the government official to keep a track of all the funds, as we will provide admin functions to the government official login credentials as well as the inventory manager where the audit log of all the changes made to the inventory  is available with all the admins.</br>
Further the task is to make a website which provides a simple UI so that the users do not feel intimidated and is easy to understand by just looking at it.</br>
